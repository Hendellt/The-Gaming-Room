# The-Gaming-Room
The client was The Gaming Room. The client wants to develop a game to be played on multiple platforms. In the document. I did I good job in articulating my points and doing 
research for them. working through the design document was helpful because it sort of gave me an outline to code with. If given the opportunity, I would like to revise the 
Executive Summary and the Design Constraints. I chose these because early on I was confused as to what exactly the client was asking for. I was focusing on the different 
operating systems rather than the browsers that the application would run on. It is important to consider the userâ€™s needs when designing because they are ultimately who you are 
doing it for. So things like the unique player and team names go a long way.
